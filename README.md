### Hi there 👋
My name is Abdon Morales, I am CS HS student from IDEA Montopolis and work here in Austin Texas, I am 16 years old, and running my own startup company called Morales Research Corp.

I'm currently working on my own Linux distrobutions which are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. (Sun/OS Linux and Mainframe/OS Enterprise Linux)

I'm currently learning Python, JavaScript, Dart, Flutter, Rust, and C (In progress).

I'm looking to collaborate on the Linux Kernel in drivers

Ask me about computers and new bleeding edge UI changes in GNOME, KDE, or Ubuntu Yaru.

Fun fact: I started to learn code when I first used my new computer in early 2015/2012
