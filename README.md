### Hi there 👋

😁 My name is Abdon Morales, I am CS HS student from IDEA Montopolis and work here in Austin Texas, I am 16 years old, and running my own startup company called Morales Research Corp.

👉 I'm currently working on my own Linux distrobutions which are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. [Sun/OS Linux and Mainframe/OS Enterprise Linux]https://gitlab.com/morales-research-corporation

🏃 I'm currently learning Python, JavaScript, Dart, Flutter, Rust, and C (In progress).

🛠 I'm looking to collaborate on the Linux Kernel in drivers or memory allocation

🖥 Ask me about computers and new bleeding edge UI changes in GNOME, KDE, or Ubuntu Yaru.

💾 Fun fact: I started to learn code when I first used my new computer in early 2015/2012
